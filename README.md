## What is this for?

I know, UEFI Shell exists and feels alright, but how about making another simple Disk Operating System _i do not mean DOS haha_ for
simple disk management?

But to the point: *why?*

If you want to install macOS on PC, or some other OS and you're just bored of turning PC off, then back on, edit file, next off again _doesn't work_, on again blah blah blah, the *Inside* is made especially for _You_.
